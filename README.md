## Project Overview

**Title:** CPS 3740 Team Research – Design a Web Database Application

**Team Name:** Team Zillow

This project is part of the CPS 3740 course, focusing on designing a web database application. Our chosen website for the project is Zillow.com, and our team comprises four members specializing in different aspects of the project.

## Objectives

1. **Design a User-Centric Database Application:** To create a web-based database application that enhances user interaction with real estate data, emulating the core functionalities of Zillow.com.

2. **Incorporate Essential Data Inputs and Outputs:** To identify and implement key data inputs and outputs that align with user needs, such as property searches, listings, and account management.

3. **Develop a Robust Database Schema:** To design a comprehensive E-R diagram that accurately represents the data flow and relationships within the application.

4. **Implement SQL Table Creation and Functions:** To create SQL statements for table creation and outline essential functions that interact with the database, such as account creation, property saving, and search history management.

## Key Deliverables

- **Web Database Design:** A detailed proposal outlining the design of the web database application, including data inputs/outputs, E-R diagrams, and SQL table creation scripts.
  
- **Function Implementation:** Documentation of core functions and their interactions with the database, including pseudo-codes and SQL statements.

- **Team Collaboration:** Ensuring effective teamwork and equal contribution, with a penalty system for teams with fewer than three members.

- **Final Report Submission:** The project will culminate in a comprehensive report, formatted as per the course guidelines, and submitted via email by the deadline.
